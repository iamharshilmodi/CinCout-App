# CinCout-App

This is a hostel check-in/check-out full stack ios application where students living in hostel can scan the NFC at the entrance of the hostel and mark their checkout/checkin using the app. 

The API is developed using flask and the data is stored on the server side having one-to-many relationship from student to entries.
